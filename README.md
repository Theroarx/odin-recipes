# odin-recipes

This is for a project from "The Odin Project", the goal of which is to build a basic recipes website. The website will have a main page with links to a few recipes.

Skills to be used include creating relative links in HTML to different webpages with recipes on them, creating ordered and unordered lists, and using headings of different levels.
