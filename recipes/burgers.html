        <h2>A simple recipe for making plain burgers.</h2>

        <p>This one is pretty simple, but still one of my favorites.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Angus ground beef, 93% lean</li>
            <li>One packet of onion dry soup and dip mix (per pound of beef)</li>
            <li>One raw egg</li>
            <li>Buns (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the grill at a medium temperature (400-600)</li>
            <li>Mix beef with the onion powder and the raw egg in a mixing bowl</li>
            <li>After thorough mixing, form half pound spheres by hand</li>
            <li>Flatten the burgers into pattys, being sure to keep the center of each patty slightly thinner than the outsides, to allow for better cooking</li>
            <li>Cook each patty for roughly 15 minutes, flipping them halfway</li>
            <li>After they are finished cooking, feel free to put them on buns and dig in!</li>
        </ol>
